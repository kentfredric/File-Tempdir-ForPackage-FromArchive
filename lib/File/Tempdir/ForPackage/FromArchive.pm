=head1 NAME

File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive - Inflate any archive to a temporary directory and work in it.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive;

	my $stash = File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive->new(
		archive => 'path/to/archive.tar.gz',
	);
	while(1){
		$stash->run_once_in(sub{
			#  Disk thrashes here as
			#  archive is repeatedly checked out,
			#  modified, then erased.
		});
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most features of this module are provided by L<File::Tempdir::ForPackage>, except that empty Tempdirs are constructed containing the contents of the specified archive with Archive-Any.

This is useful if you have some sort of mutable directory state that you need to bundle with your distribution for testing as a nested archive, and you don't want changes to persist between test runs.

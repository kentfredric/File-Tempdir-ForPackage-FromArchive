NAME
    File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive - Inflate any archive to a
    temporary directory and work in it.

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive;

     my $stash = File::Tempdir::ForPackage::FromArchive->new(
      archive => 'path/to/archive.tar.gz',
     );
     while(1){
      $stash->run_once_in(sub{
       #  Disk thrashes here as
       #  archive is repeatedly checked out,
       #  modified, then erased.
      });
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Most features of this module are provided by
    File::Tempdir::"ForPackage", except that empty Tempdirs are constructed
    containing the contents of the specified archive with Archive-Any.

    This is useful if you have some sort of mutable directory state that you
    need to bundle with your distribution for testing as a nested archive,
    and you don't want changes to persist between test runs.
